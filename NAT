1. Destination NAT
2. VPN NAT

1) Destination NAT- The weirdist thing is probably looking at the NAT configuration and
it has the Origianl packet source and destination zone as Outside or Untrust.
The original packet source and dest is outside. While the security policy has post nat zone. So, if the security policy is any ip and port just zone DMZ. The Zones look like the dont match at all.

2) While you may be able to do a bi-directional NAT that Flows over a VPN. It may fail and is recommended to do two NATs.
