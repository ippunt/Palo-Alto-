1. Site to site with DHCP?
2. Site to site Dependencies
3. Some usful CLI
4. GRE Woes
5. Proxy IDs


1) It appears Dynamic DNS is not necessary. You can make the DHCP VPN device an initiatior and the other device which hopefully has a static IP passive. If peer address
is dynamic or FQDN you will need a peer identification. Both peers need the same identification just swapped local vs remote.The options are FQDN, IP address, KEYID, User FQDN email address. As long as both sides have the asymetrical ids they are good peer<->local. 


2) HAGLE  Hash, authentication, group, lifetime, encryption. Make sure they are perfect you do not want negotiation. Do not leave it up to negotation. Even PA to PA issues.


3)
test vpn ike-sa gateway  My_Ike_Gateway; initiates IKE phase 1 Tunnel
show vpn ike-sa gateway My_Ike_Gateway;
test vpn ipsec-sa tunnel My_Tunnel; initiates IKE phase 2 Tunnel
show vpn ipsec-sa tunnel My_Tunnel;
show vpn flow name My_Site_To_Site;

4)
Packet passes to GRE tunnel. Firewall does not create a session nor security policy lookup. However, when the firewall receives a packet it creates a session and security lookup. 
No QoS, Cannot be GRE and also be decryption broker, And no NAT. 

5) They are name ASCII sorted so for overlapping ensure the one you want to get hit first is ASCII alphabetically sorted as such.
