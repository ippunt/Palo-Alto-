1. Site to site with DHCP?
2. Site to site Dependencies



1) It appears Dynamic DNS is not necessary. You can make the DHCP VPN device an initiatior and the other device which hopefully has a static IP passive. If peer address
is dynamic or FQDN you will need a peer identification. Both peers need the same identification. I don't think this needs to be the Dynamic DNS address. The options are
FQDN, IP address, KEYID, User FQDN email address. As long as both sides have the asymetrical ids they are good peer<->local. 


2) HAGLE  Hash, authentication, group, lifetime, encryption.
